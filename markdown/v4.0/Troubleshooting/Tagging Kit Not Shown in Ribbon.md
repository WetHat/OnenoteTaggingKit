# The Tagging Kit Command Group Does Not Show up in the _OneNote_ Ribbon Bar

![Ribbon](../images/TaggingKitRibbon.png)

If the new commands do not show up, _OneNote_probably was still running while you where installing the tagging kit add-in. To fix this, follow the steps below and restart the tagging add-in:

1. In _OneNote_click `File -> Options -> Add-Ins`.
   The tagging kit add-in should be listed like so:
   ![Options](images/ONOptions.png)
   
2. Click on the Go at the bottom of the page.
3. On the COM Add-Ins dialog turn off the tagging kit add-in and click OK:
   ![Disabled](images/TaggingKitDisabled.png)
   
4. Reactivate the add-in by opening the COM Add-Ins dialog again.
   Select the tagging add-in and click OK:
   ![Enabled](images/TaggingKitEnabled.png)

With any luck the add-in should be working now.
