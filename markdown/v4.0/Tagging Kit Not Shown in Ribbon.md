# The Tagging Kit command group does not show up in the _OneNote_ribbon bar

If the new commands do not show up, _OneNote_probably was still running while you where installing the tagging kit add-in. To fix this, follow the steps below and restart the tagging add-in:

1. In _OneNote_click `File -> Options -> Add-Ins`.
   The tagging kit add-in should be listed like so:
   
   ![Options](https://github.com/WetHat/OnenoteTaggingKit/wiki/images/ONOptions.png)
2. Click on the Go at the bottom of the page.
3. On the COM Add-Ins dialog turn off the tagging kit add-in and click OK:
   
   ![Disabled](https://github.com/WetHat/OnenoteTaggingKit/wiki/images/TaggingKitDisabled.png)
4. Reactivate the add-in by opening the COM Add-Ins dialog again.
   Select the tagging add-in and click OK:
   
   ![Enabled](https://github.com/WetHat/OnenoteTaggingKit/wiki/images/TaggingKitEnabled.png)

With any luck the add-in should be working now
