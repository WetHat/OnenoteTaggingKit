# Working with the Search Result

![Search Result](https://github.com/WetHat/OnenoteTaggingKit/wiki/images/SearchResult.png)

When links in the _Found Pages_ panel **(1)** are tapped or clicked, _OneNote_navigates
to the corresponding page. 

Clicked links automatically get selected (indicated by a green checkmark **(3)**.
You can hold the **CTRL**-key to select multiple links or the **SHIFT**-key
to select a range of links.

The action (hamburger) menu **(2)** can be expanded to show actions,
some of which operate on the selected links.

![Search Result Actions](images/SearchResultActions.png)

Following actions are available for links in the _Found Pages_ **(q)** panel:
* **Clear Selection**: Clears link selection
* **Select All**: Selects all links in the _Found Pages_ panel **(1)**.
* **Copy Links to Pages**:  Copies all selected hyperlinks. These links can then be pasted into _OneNote_pages, or any other application that can work with hyperlinks.
  
  **Note:**
  * Generating links to a large number of _OneNote_ pages can take a long time.
    Please wait for the progress display to disappear before attempting to paste
    the links.
  * No links to _OneNote_pages which have been deleted but are still
    in the _OneNote Recycle Bin_ are created.
* **Refresh**: Re-runs the search and updates the search result. This action is handy when the 'Find Tagged Pages' dialog has been open for a long time and tagging operations were performed on pages or new pages were created in  the meantime.
* **Tag Selected Pages** - Open the _Tag Pages_ dialog to change tags on the pages selected
  in the _Found Pages_ list. See also: [[Tagging a Page]]
* **Mark Selected Pages** - Add a marker tag to the pages selected in the _Found Pages_ list.
