# Finding Related Notes

To find related notes it is sometimes more convenient to use a more lenient way to filter pages
than progressive refinement. The progressive refinement approach is based on the _intersection_ of
page sets having all the selected tags. The resulting pages have **all** of the selected tags.
This is an efficient way to quickly reduce the number of pages in a search result,
particularly if multiple tags are selected.
