## Clearing Tag Selection

Tap or click the _'reset'_ button **(4)**. This removes any
tag based filtering and shows the complete search result.

## Locating Tags in the _Refinement Tags_ Panel

To narrow down the number of tags shown in _Refinement Tags_ panel **(5)**,
following filtering techniques are available:

Filtering tags by name filter terms:
   
1. Enter one or more filter terms separated by ',' (comma) in the filter input box **(2)**.
   The filter is applied as you type. Filter term matches are highlighted in tag names.
   Only tags matching any of the filter terms will be shown in the _Refinement Tags_ panel **(5)**.
   All other tags will be hidden until the filter is cleared.
   
   To clear the tag name filter, tap or click the _'reset'_ button **(3)**

2. Using filter Presets.
   Preset filters are _dynamic_. They generate filter terms based on the tags found on
   the current _OneNote_page, section, or section group. To use the preset filters:
   1. Tap or click the 'Presets' **(1)** menu
   2. Chose one of the pre-defined filters.
