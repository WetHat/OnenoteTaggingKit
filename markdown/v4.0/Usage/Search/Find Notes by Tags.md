# Find Notes by Tags

![Find by Tags](images/FindPagesByTags.png)

Finding notes by tags only does not use any full text search criterion.
To include a full text search criterion with your search, see
[[Find notes by facetted search|Facetted-Search]].

To perform a _tags-only_ search follow these steps:

1. Leave the query
   input area  **(2)** empty. This is the default when you open the dialog.
   If there is text in the input field **(2)**, delete it.
2. Optionally pick a scope **(1)** to limit the range of pages to search for.
3. Select one or more tags in the _Refinement Tags_ panel  **(3)** by
   tapping or clicking. Selected tags are marked by a red _filter_ symbol and
   the number in parenthesis is updated to show the number of pages which have the
   selected tag. Refer to [[Working with Refinement Tags]] for more ways to
   work with tags. 
4. Tap or click on any link in the 'Found Pages' panel  **(4)** to navigate to the
   corresponding _OneNote_page. See [[Working with the Search Result]] for more ways
   to work with the search result.
