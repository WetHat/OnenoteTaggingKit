# Sharing Tag Suggestions

Tag suggestions are shared automatically to all users of a notebook who have the
tagging kit installed. However, sometimes you want to share your
taxonomy (the set of tags you use on _OneNote_pages) to people who work on
their own notebooks. To to do that follow the steps below:

1. On the _OneNote_Home tab click on the _Settings_ button in the Page Tags command group:
   ![Settings Button](https://github.com/WetHat/OnenoteTaggingKit/wiki/images/SettingsButton.png)

2. One the _Manage Settings_ dialog, right-mouse click
   in the tags pane and select _Copy Tags_:
   
   ![Copy Tags](https://github.com/WetHat/OnenoteTaggingKit/wiki/images/CopyTagSuggestions.png)

3. Paste the comma separated list of tags in to an e-mail or instant message.
   The person receiving the message can paste the list of tags
   into the input line of the _Manage Settings_ dialog to make the tags
   available for tagging pages
