# Why are Tags Useful? {.title}

You may already have seen tags on social media sites (hashtags)
or shopping sites (product tags).

Tags are used to add organizational information (meta data) to
articles, posts, tweets, notes, or web pages in general.

The additional information provided by tags allows to efficiently
organize semi- or unstructured information in a way which vastly
improves its discoverability. Particularly by allowing to:
* filter information by one or more tags
  ([Faceted Search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faceted_search)).
* full text search for pages

The _OneNote Tagging Kit_ add-on supports both discovery methods.

For background information on how page tags improves note management in
_OneNote_ see: [Organizing Notes with Page Tags][Organizing Notes with Page Tags.md].

Can you use the _OneNote_ built in tagging system to achieve this?

The short answer is: not quite. The built-in  OneNote paragrap tags are labor
intensive to manage, and not easily shareable among multiple devices or users.
They cannot take part in facetted and full text search either.
