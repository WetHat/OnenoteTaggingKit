A free to-use, add-in to add page tagging and advanced search to _OneNote_

# Feature Overview

* Unlike the build-in OneNote paragraph tags, _Tagging Kit Page Tags_ mark an
  entire page. The _OneNote Tagging Kit_ utilizes _Page Tags_ to provide
  an enhanced search experience which allows to search for pages by
  [Faceted Search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faceted_search)
  combined with full-text queries.
  Search results can be dynamically refined by adding additional
  _Page Tag_ or full text conditions to the filter.
* The add-in provides several integrated dialogs to apply, manage, and search
  with page tags.
* Tagging operations are performed in the background. _OneNote_ can be used
  normally while tagging is in progress.
* Page Tags are based on _OneNote_ paragraph tags and are automatically shared
  to all connected OneNote clients. If a _OneNote_ client does not have the
  _Tagging Kit_ installed, it still has access to the page tags via
  the built-in _OneNote_ tagging system. If a connected _OneNote_ client has the
  _Tagging Kit_ add-in, full tagging functionality is available.

Version specific features are covered in the [release specific](#releases)
documentation of the add-in.

# About Tagging

[The Use of Tags](Use%20of%20Tags.md) briefly outlines the concept behind tags
for information management.

Some thoughts about the use of _Page Tags_ to organize notes in _OneNote_ can
be found in [Organizing Notes with Page Tags](Organizing%20Notes%20with%20Page%20Tags.md).

documentation ;-).
