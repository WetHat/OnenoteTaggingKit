# _OneNote Tagging Kit_ Add-In{.title}

A free to-use, add-in to add page tagging to _OneNote 
forÂ the desktop_. The add-in is hosted as _Open Source_ project on
[GitHub](https://github.com/WetHat/OnenoteTaggingKit).

# Feature Overview

* Unlike the build-in OneNote paragraph tags, _Tagging Kit Page Tags_ mark an
  entire page. The _OneNote Tagging Kit_ utilizes these page tags to provide
  an enhanced search experience which allows to search for pages by
  [Faceted Search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faceted_search).
  Search results can be dynamically refined by adding _Page Tags_ or full text
  searches to the filter.
* The Add-In provides several dialogs to apply, manage, and search with page tags.
* Tagging operations are performed in the background. _OneNote_ can be used
  normally while tagging is in progress. 
* Page Tags are based on _OneNote_ paragraph tags and are automatically shared
  to all connected OneNote clients. If a _OneNote_ client does not have the
  _Tagging Kit_ installed, it still has access to the page tags via
  the built-in _OneNote_ tagging system. If a connected _OneNote_ client has the
  _Tagging Kit_ add-in, full tagging functionality is available.

Version specific features are covered in the [release specific](#releases) 
documentation of the add-in.
